Q1. Main memory is not suitable for permanent storage due to its volatility. All storage could be lost if power was lost in the system. The main disadvantage to a magnetic disk compared to main memory is that the magnetic disk
operates at much slower speeds than main memory. 

Q2. The purpose of an interrupt vector is to be used by the CPU for status information on every interrupt it receives. Any said interrupt vector direcly relates to a unique number referenced in the interrupt vector table (IVT) which
holds interrupt service routines for various devices.

Q3. The purpose of an interrupt is to be used by the CPU for status information on every process/action it executes. An interrupt is different from a trap because interrupts are generated by hardware whereas traps are generated by
software. Traps can also be specifically requested from a user program via system call. Traps may be intentionally used for debugging purposes. 

Q4. Multi-core processing is more efficient because they can communicate faster between each other compared to separate chips and it will consume less power.
